    <h2>My Cat and His Story</h2>
    <p>My cat, like all cats, was an awesome cat. I could regale you all for hours with silly little stories about how he’d play with his toys, how he’d do wonderful cat-things like knocking items off tables, lounging on important papers, and sleeping upwards of 37 hours a day - all while looking regal, majestic, and fully in charge of the household. I could inundate you with gigs of pictures of my cat as well - thousands of images, in most of which he looks perturbed or upset for some reason,  but also many where he’s far more adorable than any human babies I’ve seen, but i wont! sorry.</p>
